# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using TensorFlow and OpenCV

## Project Overview
This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using deep learning techniques with TensorFlow and computer vision methods with OpenCV. The system detects and recognizes license plates from images and video streams, enabling automated vehicle identification.

## Features
- Detects license plates from images or video frames.
- Recognizes the characters on detected number plates using a trained deep learning model.
- Preprocessing of images to improve detection and recognition accuracy.
- Model training pipeline with custom dataset.
- Real-time deployment demo using webcam or video input.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow (Object Detection API)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
